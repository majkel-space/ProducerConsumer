## Order Center

- This is the store that customers enter and place orders from registers where a employee awaits them
- There are 5 Registers (Cashiers) (different threads)
- Only Two employees(Simon and Simon -> Simons) call to the Warehouse for to place orders
- Simons read from the queue and calls the warehouse ensuring the order is placed
- The order queue is a shared resource amongst 3 cashiers and simon
- Orders are collected in a local cached queue
- Each order is a request to Warehouse
- Response is received once the order is delivered to Warehouse (not when it's delivered)
- Each Simon can make 1 phone-call at a time
- Since each simon has a different phone line, they have different clients
- producer-consumer is implemented with a semaphore(number of simons)
- When an order is placed and each simon is talking, order waits for a simon to call the warehouse and get an approval
- This is a blocking operation

## Warehouse

- Warehouse manager is Dan
- Each call from Simons is transferred to Dan
- Dan places orders to queue where delivery cars will read from
- Dan is the server
- Warehouse has multiple DeliveryCars for orders
- Each delivery car takes random amount of time to deliver a single order
- Due to traffic and chaos a delivery may take EstimatedTime + RandomWastedTime(between 0-0.5 of estimated time)
- Dan checks if the orders are made in time
- If the random estimated time is 3 seconds, Dan gets mad if it's delivered in 1.2 times Estimated 3.6seconds
- Each delivery car has its own thread
- The orders are collected into a producer-consumer queue with mutex and cv
- When delivery is made and car returns, Dan is notified (promise-future) (`queue<future<order>>`)
- In a detached thread Dan keeps time for orders
- If the critical time (time which makes Dan angry) is met and the car is not returned, Dan punches a wall `std::cerr`
- If delivery is on time Dan is happy `std::cout`
